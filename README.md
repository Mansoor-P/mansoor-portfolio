### Suggested Git Branching Model

Here’s a clear and organized Git branching system you can use:

1. **`main` (or `master`) branch**:
   - This is the stable branch where the production-ready code resides.
   - Only merge tested, stable, and completed features here.
   - You will deploy your portfolio from this branch.
2. **`dev` (or `development`) branch**:
   - This is the integration branch for all development work.
   - All the work from feature branches will be merged into `dev` before being merged into `main`.
   - This is where you will do active development and testing for your responsive portfolio.
3. **`feature` branches**:

   - These branches are for specific features you're working on.
   - For example, you might create branches for the layout changes, different media queries for each device type, or specific components.
   - Name them according to the feature you're implementing.
   - Example: `feature/desktop-layout`, `feature/tablet-layout`, `feature/mobile-layout`, `feature/navbar`.

4. **`bugfix` branches** (optional):

   - If you have any bug fixes, create branches to handle them.
   - Example: `bugfix/navbar-fix`.

5. **`hotfix` branches** (optional):
   - These are for emergency fixes that need to go directly into production.
   - These branches should be merged quickly and then removed after the fix is deployed.
   - Example: `hotfix/header-logo-fix`.

### Steps to Implement Your Branching System

1. **Initialize the `main` branch** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create the `dev` branch**:

   After creating the `main` branch, create the `dev` branch for all development:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   git push -u origin dev
   ```

3. **Create Feature Branches**:

   For each feature you work on, create a new feature branch based on `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/desktop-layout
   ```

   After completing the feature, commit and push the changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented desktop layout"
   git push -u origin feature/desktop-layout
   ```

   Repeat this process for each feature (tablet layout, mobile layout, etc.):

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/tablet-layout
   git push -u origin feature/tablet-layout
   ```

4. **Merge Feature Branches into `dev`**:

   Once your feature branch is complete and tested, merge it back into `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git merge feature/desktop-layout
   git push origin dev
   ```

5. **Testing**:

   Work in the `dev` branch to test all features together, ensuring that the desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts are responsive.

6. **Merge `dev` into `main`**:

   After successfully testing and ensuring everything works well in `dev`, merge `dev` into `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a `dev` branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   git push -u origin dev
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branches for each layout:**

   For the desktop layout:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/desktop-layout
   ```

   For the tablet layout:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/tablet-layout
   ```

   For the mobile layout:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/mobile-layout
   ```

3. **Develop and Test in Feature Branches**:

   - Develop the layout for each device (desktop, tablet, mobile) in separate branches.
   - Once you're done with a feature, commit and push it.

4. **Merge Feature Branches into `dev`:**

   Once a layout is complete, merge it into `dev`:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git merge feature/desktop-layout
   git push origin dev
   ```

   Repeat for `tablet-layout` and `mobile-layout` after each feature is complete.

5. **Test in `dev`**:
   Test the portfolio for responsiveness in the `dev` branch.

6. **Merge `dev` into `main`** (when everything is ready for production):

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary of Branches:

- `main` (or `master`) – Stable, production-ready code.
- `dev` – Active development and integration.
- `feature/desktop-layout`, `feature/tablet-layout`, `feature/mobile-layout` – Separate branches for each layout.
- `bugfix` – For fixing bugs.
- `hotfix` – For emergency production fixes.

This branching model will allow you to keep your code organized and maintain smooth development for the responsive layout across devices. It also allows for easy collaboration, testing, and managing multiple features independently.
